Hey there! Welcome to **ProjectGlyphMotion**. This is our personal dive, as two enthusiastic amateurs, into the fascinating world of **real-time object tracking and image segmentation**. We're super excited to be harnessing the power of **Ultralytics YOLOv8 (m)** to make some genuinely cool visual analysis happen.

### ‚ú® What It's All About

So, what does ProjectGlyphMotion actually *do*? Well, you feed it a video, and it processes that video in real-time, giving you an output that **tracks all the objects** and marks it . This is a personal project from two amateurs exploring computer vision.

### üí° Our Journey So Far

This project has been an amazing hands-on learning experience for us. We've tackled everything from setting up the development environment (which, let's be honest, can be a headache sometimes!) to truly understanding the YOLO model and trying to squeeze out the best performance for real-time applications. Every bug and challenge has been a stepping stone, and we're hoping our code can offer a clear path for here anyone else just starting out.

### ü§ù Want to Help Out?

We're always learning, and we'd love your input! If you've got suggestions, spot a bug, or just want to bounce some ideas around, feel free to open an issue or send us a pull request. Every bit of help makes ProjectGlyphMotion better.
